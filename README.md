The website follows the 2023 style guide created by Drayko Medlyn and Shreya Arora's edit on the 2023 sponsorship prospectus. This website aims to improve the interactive experience by limiting relatively expensive user interaction. i.e. click (occupational disease prevention for developers and gamers), and scrolling (because who has time to read). Hence we are promoting a "peak and seek" interaction through effects like hover, animation and more. Attempt to gamify an information site, which seeks to inform.
